reviews:


1.) "the Emeryville Community Organic Garden, ECOG, is a huge bonus to living in Emeryville. With the diminutive size of most condos, it's great to have a little outside space to plant some veggies and take in the air.

Plus points for being unlocked and open to the public (and to the public for not regularly raiding our plots), for beautifying the new Emeryville pathway along Doyle, and for donating some 125 lbs of  edible greens to local charities in the last year.

This garden was established by the late Elaine Bradshaw Drukman, for whom a plaque and garden bench are dedicated. Elaine....great job, and rest in peace!"

2.) "We love to walk through this garden whenever we are in the neighborhood.  It's fun to look at what each plot has chosen to grow and wonder why they grow what they grow. Which brings me to my only complaint. Why on Earth would someone grow stinging nettles in a community garden without a warning sign?
Here I am, teaching my daughter that you can often tell what a plant is by touching it and then smelling your hand.  One touch and ouch! It was like getting bit by a cute puppy dog. Now maybe the stinging nettle grower is cultivating this plant to keep touchy feely people at bay but at least have some broadleaf dock growing nearby to soothe a child's hand. Or a sign."

3.) "Total fan! I used to take my dogs around here for walks. They love all the scents that come from this garden. It's fascinating to see where the food comes from and how food is grown. I would recommend this place to families and kids who would like to learn more about this organization or visit this garden.

The only thing is to make sure to obey the rules of this garden so others can enjoy this too."

Fort Mason Community garden
 
about: In the early 1970s, Ruth Asawa, Ann-Marie Thielen, and other artists and community activists organized the San Francisco Art Commission.  One of its goals was to promote community gardening in San Francisco, with an emphasis on bringing gardening to public school children. 

reviews: 
1.) "The views are amazing. The day was perfect, not to cold and the sun was shinning brightly. There was a slight breeze but not to windy.

We walked all over and looked at the flowers and the views. We stumbled upon some guys sitting at the stairs who had parked their bikes and were drinking a beer overlooking the bay. Made me wish I brought some beers to enjoy the moment with.

The Sweet Peas and other climbing vines were in full force of dark pinks and bright oranges. There was some orange flower"

2.) "I love this place!  I wish I had a green thumb so I could have a small plot here to have a garden of my own.  What an ingenious idea to have a community garden in this City of apartments and condos with limited or no yards so that garden-plots can be enjoyed and tended to."

3.) "This place is a hidden gem.  We stumbled across it on our way back to the car parked nearby after attending Off the Grid for dinner last summer.  Even my friend who lives in SF didn't know about it.  

The place is peaceful, with lots of plots with veggies (some huge squash!), flowers, plants, some fruit trees in the back.  There were a few other people there--visiting also or tending their plot?"

SF Argonne community garden

About: Come reclaim your sanity by visiting this peaceful and beautiful community garden. Argonne garden has a full of an array of flowers and overflowing organic vegetables in individual plots. I have a plot here with sweet peas, green beans, chard, zucchini, spinach, lettuce, carrots, with yellow, orange, white and coral pink poppys lining the frame. I love caring for my ever growing plants, and being able to harvest and get sustenance from food I grew myself. There's nothing like it.  The garden is a fun and safe place for kids to explore in nature, look for bugs and get their hands in the dirt. The micro climate in the outer Richmond is cooler, so bring a sweatshirt. After you visit the garden you can zip down Fulton to the beach which is only five minutes away.

reviews:

1.) "With around 40 plots and some of the neighborhood's characters tending, I couldn't ask for a better spot to attempt growing some peas, lettuce, and basil. While I did find one gardener walking his cat on a leash through the tiny greenhouse onsite, everyone's been full of humor and kindness.

The garden's open for anyone to go visit and the plots are only $35 for a the whole year. And unlike a bunch of other community gardens that I looked into, I was able to get a space immediatley."

3.) "Incredible environment, their land stewardship is absolutely incredible and the place just screams ABUNDANCE! I was thrilled to meet the farm manager Joseph, he was incredibly accommodating, insightful and passionate. I look forward to visiting this morning for the weekly farmers market from 10-4

Potrero Hill Community Garden

Lorraine Vinson, one of the founding gardeners, has had a plot here fore more than 30 years. She remembers that the gardeners began meeting as a group around 1972. The land, owned by the Recreation and Parks Department, has been a part of the Community Garden Program for many years. Each of the fifty plots is tended by neighbors using only organic methods and the gardeners commit to sharing the upkeep of the common areas, shade garden, and the sidewalk landscapes.

We welcome you to visit our garden, one of the few open and unlocked Community Gardens in our city. We trust that you will enjoy the beauty and the view, but please resist the temptation to pick our flowers or produce. Many of us toil for months to produce vegetables that we depend on to help us feed our families.

reviews: 
1.) "The rose garden is amazing in the summer months - the camellia forest during the rest of the year is equally beautiful.  I highly recommend getting the yearly membership - it allows you access to many gardens throughout the US.  Wandering the gardens is a great way to relax - a true escape from the concrete and hurry.  They also have programs like yoga and pilates.  Children can also enjoy a train ride.  Overall a great escape."

2.) "Amazing community garden. Beautiful park nearby and the most amazing views of all community gardens. Gardeners are super friendly to talk to. When you are finished visiting, you can drive down the REAL crookedest street in SF - Vermont Street!"

3.) "Nice views, calm peaceful place, meditative Oasis in the midst of urban madnesd"

reviews:

1.) "An awesome food forest - volunteer run that is doing great things for this neighborhood and city! Absolutely beautiful place to visit and I highly recommend volunteering for them!"

2.) "The Beacon Food Forest strikes me as a very thoughtful and open-minded project. The various volunteer groups and grants that are behind this space have a very community-centered approach. There are several areas that are open to foraging, including a double-helix shaped raised bed area, and a raspberry patch (ripe at the time of our visit in June!). There are garden plots which are rented out by community members. Finally, there is a nice rest area structure that folks can use to sit and find some shade.

Enjoy a peaceful stroll through the food forest and you will probably learn so much about the local ecology and permaculture!"

3.) "Fruit and berries and greens and herbs.

The upper half is space for locals to garden, you can contact the Food Forest and apply for space.

The lower half is fully open to the public to pick from. The park gets a little bare in winter but you can still find greens and herbs."

Or, you can simply come during your lunch break, sit down, and find peace for free.

reviews: 

1.) "This community garden is an oasis. It is the place I went regularly during my short Seattle stint. The garden, like my vote of Elliott Bay changed daily. It was a great please to be mindful.

The plots and rerun by people in the community and the wait list is long. I'm just grateful people care enough to share beauty in the hood.

Please visit and take care to spread love. The spring and summer are the best time, but there's magic 24/7 365." 

2.) "Absolutely beautiful & stunning community garden. It's technically located behind some residences, but many people in the community "own" a piece where they have to maintain and grow a garden, it's totally cool. There's some beautiful mosaic work, and it's very fun to check out all the flowers and plants here. A really nice guy who lives in the area happened to be there and told us all about the garden and the plants."
